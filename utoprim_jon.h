// 1: 1-D E'(W')  (really has 3 roots, but seemingly always positive-most root found AND correct root)
// 2: 2-D E'(W',v^2) and P^2(W',v^2) (unsure how many roots)
// 3: 1-D E'(W') Jon's method without intermediate v^2 and using \tilde{u}^2 instead of v^2 -- avoids catastrophic cancellation (still has 3 roots)
#define WHICHHOTINVERTER 3

// whether to do final calculation of primitives from v^2 or \tilde{u}^2
// 0: from \tilde{u}^2 -- avoids catastrophic cancellation at high Lorentz factors
// 1: from v^2 -- requires computing \gamma from 1/sqrt(1-v^2) which has problems when v^2\sim 1
#define PRIMFROMVSQ 0


// 0: original 1-D but with E' (W and v^2, but can give nan's when Wp<0 slightly -- maybe fixed with new normalization?) (apparently also not giving unique solution)
// 1: Jon's simple 1-D E' (no use of v^2, but obtains an inconsistent v^i[P^2,E'])  (apparently also not giving unique solution)
//    Uses same as WHICHHOTINVERTER==3
// 2: simple 1-D P^2 (no use of v^2, obtains a consistent v^i[P^2]) (but 4 roots and never sure which one is right -- not always positive root.  If D<0, then can be negative root)
// 3: 1-D P^\alpha error on all 3 components of P^i so there is a unique answer (NOT DONE YET)
