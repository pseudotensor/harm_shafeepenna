   and specstructimponly
   Categories: memory, implicit
   Default Setting: -
   Set locally
   
allmacros
   sets fcnmacros and constmacros
   Category: macros
   Default Setting: -
   Set locally
      All macros (not preceded by /*@notfunction@*/) are checked as functions
      or constants depending on whether or not they have parameter lists.
      
allocmismatch
   type conversion involves storage of non-divisble size
   Categories: memorybounds, memory

assignexpose
   abstract representation is exposed (assignments only)
   Categories: exposure, abstract
   Mode Settings: --++
   Set locally
      Storage internal to the representation of an abstract type is assigned to
      an external pointer. This means clients may have access to a pointer into
      the abstract representation. If the external pointer is a parameter, the
      exposed qualifier can be used to allow the assignment, however, this is
      considered dangerous programming practice.
      
badflag
   warn about bad command line flags
   Category: help
   Default Setting: +
   Set locally
      A flag is not recognized or used in an incorrect way
      
bitwisesigned
   a bitwise logical operator does not have unsigned operands
   Categories: operations,

      An operand to a bitwise operator is not an unsigned values.  This may
      have unexpected results depending on the signed representations.
      
boolcompare
   comparison between bools (dangerous because of multiple true values)
   Categories: booleans, operations
   Mode Settings: -+++
   Set locally
      Two bool values are compared directly using a C primitive. This may
      produce unexpected results since all non-zero values are considered true,
      so different true values may not be equal. The file bool.h (included in
      splint/lib) provides bool_equal for safe bool comparisons.
      
boolfalse
   set name of boolean false (default false)
   Category: booleans
   Default Setting: -
   Set locally
   String argument.  Default: false
   
boolint

boolops
   primitive operation (!, && or ||) does not has a boolean argument
   Categories: booleans, operations
   Mode Settings: -+++
   Set locally

   Category: booleans
   Default Setting: -
   Set locally
   String argument.  Default: true

   Mode Settings: ---+
   Set locally
      A memory read references memory beyond the allocated storage.
      
boundswrite
   possible buffer overflow from an out of bounds write
   Categories: memorybounds, memory
   Mode Settings: ---+
   Set locally
      A memory write may write to an address beyond the allocated buffer.
      
branchstate
   storage has inconsistent states of alternate paths through a branch
   Category: memory
   Mode Settings: -+++
   Set locally
      The state of a variable is different depending on which branch is taken.
      This means no annotation can sensibly be applied to the storage.

   possible buffer overflow vulnerability
   Categories: warnuse, security
   Mode Settings: -+++
   Set locally
      Use of function that may lead to buffer overflow.

casebreak
   non-empty case in a switch without preceding break
   Category: controlflow
   Mode Settings: -+++
   Set locally
      Execution falls through from the previous case (use /*@fallthrough@*/ to
      mark fallthrough cases).

   file names are case insensitive (file.h and FILE.H are the same file)
   Categories: headers, files
   Default Setting: -
   Set locally
   
castexpose
   abstract representation is exposed through a cast
   Categories: exposure, abstract
   Mode Settings: --++
   Set locally
      Storage internal to the representation of an abstract type is exposed
      through a type cast. This means clients may have access to a pointer into
      the abstract representation.
      
castfcnptr
   a pointer to a function is cast to a pointer to void (or vice versa)
   Categories: typeequivalence, pointers
   Default Setting: +
   Set locally
      A pointer to a function is cast to (or used as) a pointer to void (or
      vice versa).
      
charindex
   char can be used to index arrays
   Categories: typeequivalence, arrays
   Mode Settings: +---
   Set locally
      To allow char types to index arrays, use +charindex.
      
charint
   char and int are equivalent
   Category: typeequivalence
   Mode Settings: +---
   Set locally
      To make char and int types equivalent, use +charint.
      
charintliteral
   character constants (e.g., 'a') can be used as ints
   Categories: typeequivalence, numbers
   Mode Settings: +---
   Set locally
      A character constant is used as an int. Use +charintliteral to allow
      character constants to be used as ints.  (This is safe since the actual
      type of a char constant is int.)
      
charunsignedchar
   allow char and unsigned char types to match
   Category: typeequivalence
   Mode Settings: +---
   Set locally
      To allow char and unsigned char types to match use +charunsignedchar.

   function returns with a checkmod global aliasing external state
   Categories: aliasing, globals
   Mode Settings: -+++
   Set locally
      A global variable aliases externally-visible state when the function
      returns.
      
checkpost
   unable to verify predicate in ensures clause
   Categories: memorybounds, memory

   Categories: initializations, comments
   Default Setting: -
   Set locally
   Character Argument.  Default: @
      Set the marker character for syntactic comments. Comments beginning with
      /*<char> are interpreted by Splint, where <char> is the comment marker
      character.

compdef
   parameter, return value or global completely defined
   Categories: memory, definition
   Mode Settings: -+++
   Set locally
      Storage derivable from a parameter, return value or global is not
      defined. Use /*@out@*/ to denote passed or returned storage which need
      not be defined.
      
compdestroy
   all only references derivable from void pointer out only parameter are
   released
   Categories: memory, leaks
   Mode Settings: -+++
   Set locally
      A storage leak due to incomplete deallocation of a structure or deep
      pointer is suspected. Unshared storage that is reachable from a reference
      that is being deallocated has not yet been deallocated. Splint assumes
      when an object is passed as an out only void pointer that the outer
      object will be deallocated, but the inner objects will not.
      
compmempass
   actual parameter matches alias kind of formal parameter completely 
   Categories: memory, definition
   Mode Settings: -+++
   Set locally
      Storage derivable from a parameter does not match the alias kind expected
      for the formal parameter.
      
constmacros

   String argument.  No default.
      A constant does not start with the constantprefix
      
constprefixexclude
   the constprefix may not be used for non-constant identifiers
   Categories: names, prefixes
   Default Setting: -
   Set locally
      An identifier that is not a constant starts with the constantprefix.
      
constuse
   constant declared but not used
   Category: alluse
   Mode Settings: -+++
   Set locally
      A constant is declared but not used. Use unused in the constant
      declaration to suppress message.
      
continuecomment
   line continuation marker (\) in comment before */ on same line
   Categories: comments, 
   Default Setting: -
   Set locally
      A line continuation marker (\) appears inside a comment on the same line
      as the comment close. Preprocessors should handle this correctly, but it
      causes problems for some preprocessors.
      
controlnestdepth
   set maximum nesting depth of compound statements, iteration control
   structures, and selection control structures (ANSI89 minimum is 15;
   ISO99 is 63)

      A break statement appears inside the body of a nested while, for or
      switch statement. Sets looploopbreak, loopswitchbreak, switchloopbreak,
      switchswitchbreak, and looploopcontinue.
      
deparrays
   array elements are dependent storage
   Categories: memory, arrays
   Mode Settings: --++
   Set locally
      When an element is fetched from an array, Splint analysis is not able to
      determine if the same element is reused. If +deparrays, Splint will mark
      local storage assigned from array fetches as dependent.

   number of significant characters
   Categories: names, ansi
   Default Setting: -
   Set locally
      An external name is not distinguishable from another external name using
      the number of significant characters. According to ANSI Standard (3.1),
      an implementation may only consider the first 6 characters significant,
      and ignore alphabetical case distinctions (ISO C99 requires 31). The
      +externalnamelen <n> flag may be used to change the number of significant
      characters, and -externalnamecaseinsensitive to make alphabetical case
      significant in external names.

      An internal name is not distinguishable from another internal name using
      the number of significant characters. According to ANSI89 Standard (3.1),
      an implementation may only consider the first 31 characters significant
      (ISO C99 specified 63). The +internalnamelen <n> flag changes the number
      of significant characters, -internalnamecaseinsensitive to makes
      alphabetical case significant, and +internalnamelookalike to make
      similar-looking characters non-distinct.

evalorder
   code has unspecified or implementation-dependent behavior because of order
   of evaluation
   Categories: undefined, ansi
   Mode Settings: -+++
   Set locally
      Code has unspecified behavior. Order of evaluation of function parameters
      or subexpressions is not defined, so if a value is used and modified in
      different places not separated by a sequence point constraining
      evaluation order, then the result of the expression is unspecified.
      
evalorderuncon
   code involving call to unspecified function has undefined or
   implementation-dependent behavior
   Categories: undefined, ansi
   Mode Settings: ---+
   Set locally
      Code involving a call to function with no modifies or globals clause may
      have undefined or implementation-dependent behavior (Splint assumes the

      its globals list. Without +globnoglobs, only globals declared with
      /*@checkedstrict@*/ will produce use errors in functions without globals
      lists. The /*@globals ... @*/ control comment can be used to give a
      globals list for an unspecified function.

   break inside nested while or for
   Category: controlflow
   Mode Settings: --++
   Set locally
      A break statement appears inside the body of a nested while or for
      statement. This is perfectly reasonable code, but check that the break is
      intended to break only the inner loop. The break statement may be
      preceded by /*@innerbreak@*/ to suppress the message for this break only.
      
looploopcontinue
   continue inside nested loop
   Category: controlflow
   Mode Settings: ---+
   Set locally
      A continue statement appears inside a loop within a loop. This is

   macro parameter not used exactly once
   Categories: macros, parameters
   Mode Settings: -+++
   Set locally
      A macro parameter is not used exactly once in all possible invocations of
      the macro. To behave like a function, each macro parameter must be used
      exactly once on all invocations of the macro so that parameters with
      side-effects are evaluated exactly once. Use /*@sef@*/ to denote
      parameters that must be side-effect free.
      
macroparens
   macro parameter used without parentheses (in potentially dangerous context)
   Category: macros
   Mode Settings: -+++
   Set locally
      A macro parameter is used without parentheses. This could be dangerous if

      exhibits behavior that could not be implemented by a function.
      
macrostmt
   macro definition is syntactically not equivalent to function
   Category: macros
   Mode Settings: -+++
   Set locally
      A macro is defined in a way that may cause syntactic problems. If the
      macro returns a value, use commas to separate expressions;
      otherwise, use do { <macro body> } while (FALSE) construct.
      
macrounrecog
   unrecognized identifier in macro
   Categories: macros, unrecognized

mutrep
   representation of mutable type has sharing semantics
   Category: abstract
   Mode Settings: -+++
   Set locally
      LCL semantics requires that a mutable type exhibits sharing semantics. In
      order for objects to be shared a indirection is necessary in the
      representation. A mutable type may be represented by a pointer or an

realcompare
   dangerous equality comparison between reals (dangerous because of inexact
   floating point representations)
   Category: operations
   Mode Settings: -+++
   Set locally
      Two real (float, double, or long double) values are compared directly
      using == or != primitive. This may produce unexpected results since

retalias
   function returns alias to parameter or global
   Category: aliasing
   Mode Settings: --++
   Set locally
      The returned value shares storage with a parameter or global. If a
      parameter is to be returned, use the returned qualifier. If the result is

      A break statement appears inside the body of a while or for statement
      within a switch. This is perfectly reasonable code, but check that the

      be preceded by /*@loopbreak@*/ to suppress the message for this break
      only.
